## What is Wick?

Wick is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server built natively in C# for Godot Engine. When a Godot C# game crashes, Wick captures the exception from stderr, enriches it with Roslyn-powered source context (calling method body, surrounding lines, caller chain), and exposes the enriched exception stream to AI coding assistants. The agent sees the exception with full source-level context and can fix it in one turn instead of ten.

### What makes Wick different?

Other Godot MCP servers (like the excellent [GoPeak](https://github.com/HaD0Yun/Gopeak-godot-mcp)) focus on scene manipulation and GDScript tooling. Wick focuses on the C#/.NET developer experience:

- **Roslyn-enriched exception telemetry** -- stderr-captured C# exceptions enriched with the calling method body, surrounding source lines, enclosing type, and caller chain. No other Godot MCP server does this.
- **In-process exception capture** -- optional Wick.Runtime NuGet companion catches TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException and async exceptions that stderr can't see.
- **Build diagnostics with source context** -- dotnet build errors enriched with Roslyn source context through the same pipeline as runtime exceptions.
- **C# analysis tools** -- find symbol, find references, member signatures via Roslyn workspace.
- **5-pillar tool group system** -- activate only what you need: core, runtime, csharp, build, scene.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) (10.0.201 or later)
- [Godot 4.6.1+](https://godotengine.org/) with .NET/Mono support

### Installation

    git clone https://github.com/buildepicshit/Wick.git
    cd Wick
    dotnet build Wick.slnx --configuration Release

### MCP Configuration

Add Wick to your AI coding assistant's MCP configuration:

    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "wick": {
          "command": "dotnet",
          "args": ["run", "--project", "path/to/Wick/src/Wick.Server"],
          "env": {
            "WICK_GROUPS": "core,runtime,csharp,build",
            "WICK_GODOT_BIN": "/path/to/godot",
            "WICK_PROJECT_PATH": "/path/to/your/godot-project"
          }
        }
      }
    }

### Tool Groups

Activate tool pillars via WICK_GROUPS env var or --groups CLI flag:

| Pillar | What it includes | Default |
|---|---|---|
| core | GDScript tools, scene parsing, GDScript LSP, introspection | Always on |
| runtime | Exception pipeline, game launch/stop, log tail, runtime_diagnose | Opt-in |
| csharp | Roslyn analysis, find symbol, find references, member signatures | Opt-in |
| build | dotnet build/test/clean, NuGet management, build_diagnose | Opt-in |
| scene | Scene create/modify via headless Godot dispatch | Opt-in |

Example: WICK_GROUPS=core,runtime,csharp,build or --groups=all.

### Optional: Wick.Runtime Companion

For in-process exception capture (async exceptions, TaskScheduler failures), add the Wick.Runtime NuGet to your Godot project:

    // In your Godot project's autoload or entry point:
    WickRuntime.Install();

This captures exceptions that stderr can't see and reports them to the Wick server via a TCP bridge.

## Architecture

Wick runs as an external process -- it does NOT run inside Godot. Communication:

- **stdio** -- MCP protocol to the AI client
- **TCP 6505** -- editor bridge (Godot plugin to Wick server)
- **TCP 7777** -- runtime bridge (running game to Wick server)
- **TCP 7878** -- Wick.Runtime companion bridge (in-process to Wick server)

This architecture lets Wick target .NET 10 even though Godot 4.6.1's runtime is stuck on .NET 8.
